<h4>Quote from Jontae:<strong>Your actions have a way of coming back to you</strong>YE</h4>
    
<div>BAD IDEA!!!!
You tried to rob them and when you saw their face
and it turns to bee...........MAMA P!!!!!!! (Not really ur mother)
when mama P sees you she gives you wicked kick to face.
U forgot that mama p took a 20million dollar  trip to china, while she was at that 20MILLION $
 TRIP 
she was at china brushing up on some kung-fu, she knows how to wax on and wax off.
Anyways, she sees your face, she lectured you
