<h1>BEAR CAUGHT YA</h1>
<hr>
<h4>Quote from Jontae: Although you took away ur self in that situation watch were u run</h4>
<div>You ran for dear life and escaped but you ran back to the forest  back to the forest but a wild bear appeared like a rare pokemon because when you walk from your adventure you never encountered
One. you peed yourself a little bit
and the bear saw then it didn't bother to make you its meal but you did the move
That Odysseus did in The Odyssey your pride got to you then you attempted to kill the bear, then your cowardness kicked in then you peed yourself then got mauled by the bear.
